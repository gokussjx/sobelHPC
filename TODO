What's new:

    Old `Makefile` from CUDA sample renamed to `cuda.mk`
    `inc` moved to `include/cuda` (cuda.mk changed accordingly)
    General phony make targets `all` `clean` removed from `cuda.mk`
        Note: `cuda.mk` takes care of CUDA related make vars and build CUDA related
        targets only.
        
    `standard.mk` renamed to `Makefile`
        Note: `Makefile` takes charge of build/clean of whold project
        All source files go into `src/`
        All targets go into `bin/` (which is more easily cleaned by deleting the dir)
        CUDA objects link into `bin/hw6`
    
    Sobel filter example can be found at `example/projects/SobelFilter/`
    
    Sobel example incorporated with `src/driver.cu` as `src/sobel.cu`
        For details read `src/sobel.cu` from bottom to top
    
Progress:

    Identity filter works ok, resulting 100% match. Sobel filter runs, 
    result unconfirmed, memory allocation/access/release unchecked.

Test run:

    make
    make run
    bin/diff *.pgm

Clean:

    make clean

TODO:

    Enable sobel filter by setting the enable flag inside src/sobel.cu: sobelFilter()
        And `make && make run` again
    Check result of sobel filter
    Try different logical configurations: src/sobel.cu: sobelFilter()
        SobelTex<<<ih, 384>>>(odata, iw, iw, ih, fScale );
